## Hi there!! 
My name is Rakibul Islam. I work at CareTutor, Bangladesh's Largest online and offline tutoring platform. I Have given in-person lessons on physics, mathematics, and programming Languages (Python, C, C++, and JavaScript) to high school and college-level students.

I aim to become a research scientist at a prestigious university. I am particularly interested in combining academic research with industrial collaboration. I aspire to establish my lab to conduct cutting-edge research that advances science and benefits academia and industry. As a dedicated learner, I investigate the possible benefits of artificial intelligence technology in enhancing human life. My research interests include machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence in designing and implementing research tools. My primary purpose is to develop widely implementable machine and deep learning-based solutions for real scenarios in synthetic technology. You can find out more at https://raaakibul.github.io/

Previously, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at the University of Asia Pacific.  

# Research Interests!!
My main research interest lies in Machine Learning and deep learning-based Artificial Intelligence systems. I want to research next-generation Machine Learning and Deep Learning-based AI systems. The Research interest that I have--
