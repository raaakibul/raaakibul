## Hi there!! 
I'm Rakibul Islam. I work at Bangladesh's Largest online and offline-based tutoring platform, CareTutor. I Gave in-person lessons on physics, mathematics, and programming Languages (Python, C, C++, and JavaScript) to high school and college-level students.

I aim to become a research scientist at a prestigious university. I am particularly interested in combining academic research with industrial collaboration. I aspire to establish my lab to conduct cutting-edge research that advances science and benefits academia and industry. As a dedicated learner, I investigate the possible benefits of artificial intelligence technology in enhancing human life. My research interest areas include machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence in designing and implementing research tools. My primary purpose is to develop widely implementable machine and deep learning-based solutions for real scenarios in synthetic technology. You can find out more at https://raaakibul.github.io/

Previously, I completed my Bachelorâ€™s in Computer Science at the University of Asia Pacific.
